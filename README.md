# Grocery List

This project is a simple shopping list web application created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (with jQuery). Users can add items to either a "Need" list or a "Have" list, and move items between these lists or remove them entirely.

## Features

- **Add Items**: Users can add items to the "Need" list or the "Have" list.
- **Move Items**: Users can move items between the "Need" and "Have" lists by checking/unchecking them.
- **Remove Items**: Users can remove items from the lists.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You need a web browser to run this shopping list.

### Installation

    ```

3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser:
